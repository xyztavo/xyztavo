hi, my name is gustavo and i like to do hack around

working at Central dos Mecanicos -https://centraldosmecanicos.com.br

side project Lunai - https://lunai.monster

todo: 
* make most of lunai projects free and open source (right now i just need to clean the code and use free AI models on the physique).
* **Stocks at lunai** this will help users invest using real and recent market studies with machine learning to show promissing stuff
* **LunarOs** omarchy like distro but with my configs and preferences, niri + noctalia. idk how i will build the iso. (TONARCHY TUI MAYBE BE THE ONE I WILL BE FORKING)
* **DroidLazyvim** runs alpine and setups lazyvim in a single apk
* **AlpineOnDroid** runs alpine with xfce on android, should work with usb hub to connect to a monitor with keyboard and mouse
* **lunar pos** point of sale app that will use golang + alpine (with ajax plugin) + templ (with tailwind and turso for db) so you can host a single binary to have a blazingly fast web app that can acess scanners, printers and will help you buy stuff for your own business using AI
