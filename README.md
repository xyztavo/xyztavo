hi, i like golang

working at (Central dos Mecanicos [https://centraldosmecanicos.com.br]

side project (Lunai)[https://lunai.monster)
(expect some nice stuff)

todo: 
* **lunai refactor** (big update, every .lunai.monster will be served in a single backend to simplify auth and usage and everything will be GPL 3.0 open source after i finish some stuff)
* **Stocks at lunai** (this will help users invest using real and recent market studies with machine learning to show promissing stuff)
* **Entertainment at lunai** (show cool free and open source alternatives to streaming such as netflix, youtube and twitch like grayjay and stremio with torrentio and alternatives to gapps and email like proton suite)
* **LunarOs** (omarchy like distro but with my configs and preferences)
* **DroidLazyvim** (runs alpine and setups lazyvim in a single apk)
* **AlpineOnDroid** (runs alpine with xfce on android, should work with usb hub to connect to a monitor with keyboard and mouse)
