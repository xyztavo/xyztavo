hi, i like golang

working at Central dos Mecanicos -https://centraldosmecanicos.com.br

side project Lunai - https://lunai.monster
(expect some nice stuff, WIP)

todo: 
* **lunai refactor** big update, every .lunai.monster will be served in a single backend to simplify auth and usage and everything will be GPL 3.0 open source after i finish some stuff
* **Stocks at lunai** this will help users invest using real and recent market studies with machine learning to show promissing stuff
* **Entertainment at lunai** show cool free and open source alternatives to streaming such as netflix, youtube and twitch like grayjay and stremio with torrentio and alternatives to gapps and email like proton suite
* **LunarOs** omarchy like distro but with my configs and preferences
* **DroidLazyvim** runs alpine and setups lazyvim in a single apk
* **AlpineOnDroid** runs alpine with xfce on android, should work with usb hub to connect to a monitor with keyboard and mouse
* **godoit** one single config file to replicate your system configs, deps and apps in any arch or debian based linux distro
* **lunar pos** point of sale app that will use golang + alpine (with ajax plugin) + templ (with tailwind and turso for db) so you can host a single binary to have a blazingly fast web app that can acess scanners, printers and will help you buy stuff for your own business using AI
